            <h2>Purpose of the Manifesto:</h2>
            <p>Use the Manifesto as a guide for developing or refining threat modeling methodologies.</p>
            <p>It aims to enhance the effectiveness of threat modeling, resulting in more secure applications, systems, and organizations.</p>

            <h2>Format Inspired by Agile Manifesto:</h2>
            <p>Similar to the Agile Manifesto, it includes values and principles.</p>

            <h2>Values:</h2>
            <p>Emphasizes values such as a culture focused on identifying and addressing design issues, prioritizing people and collaboration, valuing understanding over snapshots, doing threat modeling over just discussing it, and continuous improvement.</p>

            <h2>Principles:</h2>
            <p>Outlines principles including using threat modeling to enhance security and privacy, aligning it with an organization's development practices, conducting early and frequent analysis, ensuring outcomes are meaningful to stakeholders, and highlighting the importance of dialog and documentation for understanding and measurement.</p>

            <p>The Threat Modeling Manifesto is a valuable resource for anyone involved in the security of software applications, systems, and organizations. It provides a clear and concise framework for understanding and addressing security risks.</p>

          assessing whether the threat modeling process was successful. A key indicator of success is whether participants would recommend threat modeling to their colleagues. This question reflects the perceived value of the effort invested in threat modeling. A positive response indicates a job well done, while a negative one suggests the need for improvement.</p>
