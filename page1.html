            <h2>Purpose of the Manifesto:</h2>
            <p>Use the Manifesto as a guide for developing or refining threat modeling methodologies.</p>
            <p>It aims to enhance the effectiveness of threat modeling, resulting in more secure applications, systems, and organizations.</p>

            <h2>Format Inspired by Agile Manifesto:</h2>
            <p>Similar to the Agile Manifesto, it includes values and principles.</p>

            <h2>Values:</h2>
            <p>Emphasizes values such as a culture focused on identifying and addressing design issues, prioritizing people and collaboration, valuing understanding over snapshots, doing threat modeling over just discussing it, and continuous improvement.</p>

            <h2>Principles:</h2>
            <p>Outlines principles including using threat modeling to enhance security and privacy, aligning it with an organization's development practices, conducting early and frequent analysis, ensuring outcomes are meaningful to stakeholders, and highlighting the importance of dialog and documentation for understanding and measurement.</p>

            <p>The Threat Modeling Manifesto is a valuable resource for anyone involved in the security of software applications, systems, and organizations. It provides a clear and concise framework for understanding and addressing security risks.</p>

   <h1 class="content">Shostack 2022:<br>Welcome to the World's Shortest Threat Modeling Course</h1>
            <p>In Adam Shostack's "World's Shortest Threat Modeling Course," four key points guide the threat modeling process:</p>

            <h2>1. What are we working on?</h2>
            <p><b>Collaboration, Sketching, and Data Flow Diagrams</b><p> 
                <p>In this keypoint, Adam Shostack stresses the importance of collaboration and sketching in the early stages of threat modeling. He highlights that many people associate threat modeling with whiteboards, which provide a valuable platform for sketching ideas. However, Shostack goes further to explain that collaboration is not limited to physical whiteboards; it extends to online drawing tools that enable multiple individuals to draw and engage simultaneously. This collaborative approach helps address the fundamental question, "What are we working on?" <p>
                <p>Moreover, Shostack introduces the relevance of data flow diagrams (DFDs) in understanding the system's functionality and potential threats. DFDs are integral to threat modeling because they illustrate how data moves through a system. Shostack describes the five symbols used in DFDs: external entities (representing elements outside of one's control), processes (running code under one's control), data flows (connections between elements), data stores (where data is stored), and trust boundaries (delineating entities with different levels of trust). By using DFDs, teams gain a clearer picture of their system's architecture, aiding in the process of defining the scope of threat modeling.</p>

            <h2>2. What can go wrong?</h2>
            <p>Threat modeling centers around the question of what can potentially go wrong in a system. It encourages participants to express their concerns openly and provides guidance, such as using the STRIDE mnemonic to help identify threats. STRIDE stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.</p>

            <h2>3. What are we going to do about it?</h2>
            <p>Threat modeling is not just about identifying threats but also about taking action. This may involve implementing security controls, deploying new features, or managing risks. Threats are treated as development items, and action is required to mitigate them effectively.</p>

            <h2>4. Did we do a good enough job?</h2>
            <p>The final step involves assessing whether the threat modeling process was successful. A key indicator of success is whether participants would recommend threat modeling to their colleagues. This question reflects the perceived value of the effort invested in threat modeling. A positive response indicates a job well done, while a negative one suggests the need for improvement.</p>
  
    <h1 class="content">Shostack 2014:<br>Chapter 1 - Dive In and Threat Model! </h1>
            <p>In the book "Threat Modeling: Designing for Security", Adam Shostack defines threat modeling as "a process of understanding the system in terms of its assets, the threats to those assets, and the controls in place to mitigate those threats."</p>

            </p>He explains the significance of threat modeling as a proactive approach to enhance system security. By identifying and addressing threats early in development, it can prevent security breaches and data compromises.</p>

            <p><b>Common Techniques:</b></p>

            </p>He explains the significance of threat modeling as a proactive approach to enhance system security. By identifying and addressing threats early in development, it can prevent security breaches and data compromises.</p>
            
             <p><b>STRIDE:</b> This mnemonic categorizes threats as Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. It helps classify threats by their impact on a system.</p>
            <p><b>Attack Trees:</b>  These graphical representations outline potential attacker strategies, aiding in the systematic identification and prioritization of threats.</p>
            <p><b>Threat Modeling Workshops:</b> These collaborative sessions involve stakeholders from various organizational areas to discuss security threats, fostering improved communication and collaboration.</p>

             <p><b>Key Questions in Threat Modeling: <p><b>
                 
     <p><b>1.	What are we working on? <p><b>
<p>Defines the scope of the threat modeling exercise, identifying assets and potential threats.</p>

          <p><b>2.	What can go wrong? <p><b>
<p>Explores various ways attackers could compromise the system, considering even unlikely scenarios.
</p>
               <p><b>3.	How likely is it? <p><b>
<p>Evaluates the likelihood of each threat by considering attacker motivations, capabilities, and existing security controls.
</p>
                    <b>4.	What are we going to do about it? <b>
<p>Develops strategies to mitigate threats, ensuring security controls are proportionate to the level of risk.
