            <h2>Purpose of the Manifesto:</h2>
            <p>Use the Manifesto as a guide for developing or refining threat modeling methodologies.</p>
            <p>It aims to enhance the effectiveness of threat modeling, resulting in more secure applications, systems, and organizations.</p>

            <h2>Format Inspired by Agile Manifesto:</h2>
            <p>Similar to the Agile Manifesto, it includes values and principles.</p>

            <h2>Values:</h2>
            <p>Emphasizes values such as a culture focused on identifying and addressing design issues, prioritizing people and collaboration, valuing understanding over snapshots, doing threat modeling over just discussing it, and continuous improvement.</p>

            <h2>Principles:</h2>
            <p>Outlines principles including using threat modeling to enhance security and privacy, aligning it with an organization's development practices, conducting early and frequent analysis, ensuring outcomes are meaningful to stakeholders, and highlighting the importance of dialog and documentation for understanding and measurement.</p>

            <p>The Threat Modeling Manifesto is a valuable resource for anyone involved in the security of software applications, systems, and organizations. It provides a clear and concise framework for understanding and addressing security risks.</p>

   <h1 class="content">Shostack 2022:<br>Welcome to the World's Shortest Threat Modeling Course</h1>

            <h2>1. What are we working on?</h2>

            <p>**Collaboration, Sketching, and Data Flow Diagrams**</p> 
                <p>In this keypoint, Adam Shostack stresses the importance of collaboration and sketching in the early stages of threat modeling. He highlights that many people associate threat modeling with whiteboards, which provide a valuable platform for sketching ideas. However, Shostack goes further to explain that collaboration is not limited to physical whiteboards; it extends to online drawing tools that enable multiple individuals to draw and engage simultaneously. This collaborative approach helps address the fundamental question, "What are we working on?" Moreover, Shostack introduces the relevance of data flow diagrams (DFDs) in understanding the system's functionality and potential threats. DFDs are integral to threat modeling because they illustrate how data moves through a system. Shostack describes the five symbols used in DFDs: external entities (representing elements outside of one's control), processes (running code under one's control), data flows (connections between elements), data stores (where data is stored), and trust boundaries (delineating entities with different levels of trust). By using DFDs, teams gain a clearer picture of their system's architecture, aiding in the process of defining the scope of threat modeling.</p>

            <h2>2. What can go wrong?</h2>

            <p>**Threat modeling centers around the question of what can potentially go wrong in a system.** It encourages participants to express their concerns openly and provides guidance, such as using the STRIDE mnemonic to help identify threats. STRIDE stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.</p>
