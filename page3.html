<h1>Threat Model Manifesto of ABC Restaurant Chain</h1>
<h2>1. What are we working on?</h2>
<h3>Business Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the restaurant chain can serve customers during operating hours, both in-person and online.</li>
<li>Protect customer data, including personal information and payment details.</li>
<li>Securely process payments to prevent fraud.</li>
<li>Maintain a good reputation to keep customers coming back.</li>
<li>Ensure that menu items and prices are accurate and consistent across all locations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>The restaurant chain relies on POS systems to process orders and handle payments.</li>
<li>The online and mobile apps for ordering food must be secure and easy to use.</li>
<li>Customer information and order history must be stored securely in a database.</li>
<li>A reliable and secure network is needed for communication between restaurant locations and data centers.</li>
<li>The restaurant chain must integrate with secure payment gateways for processing online transactions.</li>
<li>Employee access to sensitive systems and data must be restricted using role-based access control.</li>
<li>Secure communication and data sharing must be in place with suppliers and vendors.</li>
<li>A plan for responding to security incidents must be developed to minimize potential damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The ABC Restaurant Chain is working on securing the entire restaurant operation, including customer data, payment processing, and supply chain management.
</p>
<h3>Key Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Customer data: This includes personal information such as names, addresses, and payment details. It is critical to protect this data, as a breach could result in reputation damage and legal consequences.</li>
<li>Payment systems: These systems are used to process payments from customers. It is important to ensure the security of these systems to prevent financial fraud.</li>
<li>Supply chain management: This includes the process of ensuring that food is safe and of high quality. It is important to manage the security of the supply chain to prevent tampering or contamination of food.</li>
<li>Inventory and supplies: These include ingredients, food items, and kitchen supplies. It is important to protect these assets to ensure the smooth operation of the restaurant.</li>
<li>Brand reputation: The ABC Restaurant Chain's reputation is a valuable asset. Any security incident, such as a data breach or food safety issue, can damage this reputation, impacting business operations and customer trust.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prioritization</h3>
<ul>
<li>Customer data: This is the highest priority asset, as a breach could have a significant impact on the restaurant's reputation and financial well-being.</li>
<li>Payment systems: These systems are also a high priority, as a breach could result in financial losses.</li>
<li>Supply chain management: This is a lower priority asset, but it is still important to ensure the security of the supply chain to prevent food safety issues.</li>
<li>Inventory and supplies: These assets are also important to protect, but they are not as critical as customer data or payment systems.</li>
<li>Brand reputation: This is a valuable asset, but it is not as critical as customer data or payment systems.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Security plays a significant role in supporting the restaurant business in several ways:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Customer trust: Excellent security measures, especially for customer data protection, build trust. When customers trust that their information is safe, they are more likely to dine in or order from the restaurant.</li>
<li>Legal compliance: Security measures ensure compliance with data protection regulations, avoiding costly fines and legal issues.</li>
<li>Financial protection: Securing financial assets and payment systems protects the restaurant from financial fraud and loss.</li>
<li>Food safety: Security in the form of supply chain integrity and kitchen safety measures ensures the quality and safety of food, which is essential for customer health and satisfaction.</li>
<li>Operational continuity: Security measures protect against disruptions, whether due to cyberattacks or physical incidents, ensuring smooth restaurant operations.</li>
<li>Brand reputation: By safeguarding customer data, food quality, and overall safety, security supports and enhances the restaurant's brand reputation.</li>
</ul>

           <h2>2. What Can Go Wrong?</h2>

<p>To assess whether the restaurant food chain described earlier is targeted by specific threat actors and evaluate the associated Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) as well as Capability, Opportunity, and Intent (COI), we need to consider various factors:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Type of Threat Actors:</strong> The restaurant food chain may face threats from different types of threat actors, such as cybercriminals, competitors, activists, or even disgruntled employees. Each of these threat actor types may have different motivations and capabilities.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <strong>Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):</strong> The TTPs used by threat actors can vary widely. For example:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Cybercriminals:</strong> They may employ tactics like hacking into the restaurant's point-of-sale (POS) systems to steal customer payment card data (technique), using phishing emails to deliver malware (technique), or launching distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks to disrupt online ordering (tactic).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Competitors:</strong> Competing restaurants may engage in tactics like price undercutting (tactic), spreading negative reviews online (tactic), or attempting to steal recipes and menu ideas (technique).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Activists:</strong> Activists may use tactics like organizing protests outside the restaurant (tactic) or spreading negative publicity about the restaurant's sourcing practices on social media (technique).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <strong>Capability, Opportunity, and Intent (COI)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Capability:</strong> The capability of threat actors depends on their skills, resources, and tools. Cybercriminals with advanced hacking skills and access to sophisticated malware pose a higher capability threat compared to individuals with limited technical knowledge.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Opportunity:</strong> Opportunity relates to the ease with which threat actors can carry out their attacks. For example, if the restaurant's online ordering system has weak security controls, it provides an opportunity for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Intent:</strong> Understanding the intent of threat actors is crucial. Some threat actors may be motivated by financial gain (e.g., stealing customer data for resale), while others may be motivated by causing reputational harm (e.g., activists) or gaining a competitive edge (e.g., competitors).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

            <h2>3. What are we going to do about it?</h2>

<p>To address these threats, we can utilize the following:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Data Breach Mitigation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>- Implement strong access controls for customer databases.</li>
            <li>- Encrypt customer data both in transit and at rest.</li>
            <li>- Regularly update and patch software to address vulnerabilities.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Payment Fraud Mitigation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>- Use secure POS systems that comply with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).</li>
            <li>- Conduct regular security assessments of payment processing systems.</li>
            <li>- Educate staff about payment security best practices.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Food Contamination Mitigation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>- Implement security measures in the supply chain, including tamper-evident packaging.</li>
            <li>- Ensure strict access control to food storage areas.</li>
            <li>- Monitor supply chain processes for anomalies.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>Here are some additiobnal risk mitigation strategies:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Reduce Attack Surface:</strong> Identify and implement measures to reduce the attack surface. This involves minimizing the points of vulnerability and exposure to systems. For example, the principle of least privilege to limit access can be used in practice to critical systems and data to only those who need it for their roles.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Limit Entry Points:</strong> Reduce the number of entry points that threat actors can use to access systems. This could involve implementing strong access controls, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems to monitor and restrict unauthorized access.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Risk Mitigation Strategies - Reduce, Transfer, Avoid, Accept:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduce:</strong> Take actions to reduce the likelihood or impact of identified risks. For example, if one of the risks is a data breach due to weak passwords, practice of password usage should be reminded and multi-factor authentication to reduce this risk.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Transfer:</strong> Transfer the risk to another party, typically through insurance or outsourcing. For example, the risk of a physical security breach can be transferred  to a security company responsible for on-site security.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Avoid risks by eliminating activities or processes that pose a significant threat. For example, if a specific menu item consistently poses a health risk, you can remove it from the menu.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Accept:</strong> In some cases, it might be acceptable to acknowledge the risk and accept it without taking further action. This is typically done when the risk is minimal or the cost of mitigation outweighs the potential impact of the risk.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>By applying these risk management strategies, threats can be addressed to the restaurant food chain and make informed decisions on how to best protect assets, customers, and business operations.</p>

               <h2>4.Did we do a good enough job </h2>
<p>
To determine if the security measures are effective, we should conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify weaknesses. We should also monitor for any security incidents and respond promptly. Additionally, they should seek feedback from customers and staff regarding security concerns. Finally, we should update security measures based on emerging threats and changes in the business environment.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Conduct regular security audits to evaluate the compliance of the systems and processes with security policies and standards.
</li>
<li>
Perform penetration tests to simulate real-world attacks on the systems.
</li>
<li>
Continuously assess and reassess risks to the restaurant food chain.
</li>
<li>
Maintain an ongoing threat modeling process.
</li>
<li>
Assess the effectiveness of the risk mitigations we've implemented.
</li>
<li>
Periodically test incident response plan.
</li>
<li>
Ensure that staffs are well-trained and aware of security best practices.
</li>
<li>
Monitor compliance with regulatory requirements.
</li>
<li>
Establish feedback mechanisms for employees and customers to report security concerns or incidents.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
By taking these steps, the restaurant food chain can ensure that security measures are effective and that we are taking steps to continuously improve the security posture.
