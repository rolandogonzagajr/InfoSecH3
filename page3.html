<h1>Threat Model Manifesto of ABC Restaurant Chain</h1>
<h2>1. What are we working on?</h2>
<h2>Business Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the restaurant chain can serve customers during operating hours, both in-person and online.</li>
<li>Protect customer data, including personal information and payment details.</li>
<li>Securely process payments to prevent fraud.</li>
<li>Maintain a good reputation to keep customers coming back.</li>
<li>Ensure that menu items and prices are accurate and consistent across all locations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>The restaurant chain relies on POS systems to process orders and handle payments.</li>
<li>The online and mobile apps for ordering food must be secure and easy to use.</li>
<li>Customer information and order history must be stored securely in a database.</li>
<li>A reliable and secure network is needed for communication between restaurant locations and data centers.</li>
<li>The restaurant chain must integrate with secure payment gateways for processing online transactions.</li>
<li>Employee access to sensitive systems and data must be restricted using role-based access control.</li>
<li>Secure communication and data sharing must be in place with suppliers and vendors.</li>
<li>A plan for responding to security incidents must be developed to minimize potential damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The ABC Restaurant Chain is working on securing the entire restaurant operation, including customer data, payment processing, and supply chain management.
</p>
<h2>Key Assets</h2>
<ul>
<li>Customer data: This includes personal information such as names, addresses, and payment details. It is critical to protect this data, as a breach could result in reputation damage and legal consequences.</li>
<li>Payment systems: These systems are used to process payments from customers. It is important to ensure the security of these systems to prevent financial fraud.</li>
<li>Supply chain management: This includes the process of ensuring that food is safe and of high quality. It is important to manage the security of the supply chain to prevent tampering or contamination of food.</li>
<li>Inventory and supplies: These include ingredients, food items, and kitchen supplies. It is important to protect these assets to ensure the smooth operation of the restaurant.</li>
<li>Brand reputation: The ABC Restaurant Chain's reputation is a valuable asset. Any security incident, such as a data breach or food safety issue, can damage this reputation, impacting business operations and customer trust.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prioritization</h2>
<ul>
<li>Customer data: This is the highest priority asset, as a breach could have a significant impact on the restaurant's reputation and financial well-being.</li>
<li>Payment systems: These systems are also a high priority, as a breach could result in financial losses.</li>
<li>Supply chain management: This is a lower priority asset, but it is still important to ensure the security of the supply chain to prevent food safety issues.</li>
<li>Inventory and supplies: These assets are also important to protect, but they are not as critical as customer data or payment systems.</li>
<li>Brand reputation: This is a valuable asset, but it is not as critical as customer data or payment systems.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Security plays a significant role in supporting the restaurant business in several ways:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Customer trust: Robust security measures, especially for customer data protection, build trust. When customers trust that their information is safe, they are more likely to dine in or order from the restaurant.</li>
<li>Legal compliance: Security measures ensure compliance with data protection regulations, avoiding costly fines and legal issues.</li>
<li>Financial protection: Securing financial assets and payment systems protects the restaurant from financial fraud and loss.</li>
<li>Food safety: Security in the form of supply chain integrity and kitchen safety measures ensures the quality and safety of food, which is essential for customer health and satisfaction.</li>
<li>Operational continuity: Security measures protect against disruptions, whether due to cyberattacks or physical incidents, ensuring smooth restaurant operations.</li>
<li>Brand reputation: By safeguarding customer data, food quality, and overall safety, security supports and enhances the restaurant's brand reputation.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The ABC Restaurant Chain is committed to protecting its assets and ensuring the security of its operations. By implementing appropriate security measures, the restaurant can mitigate the risks of a data breach or other security incident and protect its reputation and bottom line.
</p>
           <h2>2. What Can Go Wrong?</h2>

<p>Now, let's consider potential threats:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>a. Data Breach:</strong> Unauthorized access to customer data leading to identity theft or financial fraud.</li>
    <li><strong>b. Payment Fraud:</strong> Manipulation of payment systems, including card skimming or point-of-sale (POS) system compromise.</li>
    <li><strong>c. Food Contamination:</strong> Tampering or contamination of food items within the supply chain, leading to health risks for customers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applying the STRIDE Model:</h2>

<h3>1. Spoofing:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Unauthorized access to customer orders.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> An attacker impersonates a restaurant staff member and gains access to customer order data, potentially modifying or viewing sensitive information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Tampering:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Unauthorized modification of order data.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> An attacker intercepts an online order request and alters it, changing the contents or destination of the order.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Repudiation:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Customers deny placing an order.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> A customer claims they never made an order, leading to disputes and potential revenue loss for the restaurant.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Information Disclosure:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Exposure of customer data.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Customer payment information stored in the system is breached, leading to the exposure of credit card details.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Denial of Service (DoS):</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Online ordering system becomes unavailable.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> An attacker floods the restaurant's website with traffic, causing it to become unavailable to genuine customers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Elevation of Privilege:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Unauthorized access to administrative functions.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> An attacker exploits a vulnerability to gain administrative access, potentially modifying menu items, employee records, or financial data.</li>
</ul>

        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Assessing Threat Actors and Tactics:</h2>

<p>To assess whether the restaurant food chain described earlier is targeted by specific threat actors and evaluate the associated Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) as well as Capability, Opportunity, and Intent (COI), we need to consider various factors:</p>


    <li><strong>Type of Threat Actors:</strong> The restaurant food chain may face threats from different types of threat actors, such as cybercriminals, competitors, activists, or even disgruntled employees. Each of these threat actor types may have different motivations and capabilities.</li>
    <ol>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):</strong> The TTPs used by threat actors can vary widely. For example:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cybercriminals:</strong> They may employ tactics like hacking into the restaurant's point-of-sale (POS) systems to steal customer payment card data (technique), using phishing emails to deliver malware (technique), or launching distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks to disrupt online ordering (tactic).</li>
            
            <li><strong>Competitors:</strong> Competing restaurants may engage in tactics like price undercutting (tactic), spreading negative reviews online (tactic), or attempting to steal recipes and menu ideas (technique).</li>
            
            <li><strong>Activists:</strong> Activists may use tactics like organizing protests outside the restaurant (tactic) or spreading negative publicity about the restaurant's sourcing practices on social media (technique).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
     <ul>
    <li><strong>Capability:</strong> The capability of threat actors depends on their skills, resources, and tools. Cybercriminals with advanced hacking skills and access to sophisticated malware pose a higher capability threat compared to individuals with limited technical knowledge.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Opportunity:</strong> Opportunity relates to the ease with which threat actors can carry out their attacks. For example, if the restaurant's online ordering system has weak security controls, it provides an opportunity for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Intent:</strong> Understanding the intent of threat actors is crucial. Some threat actors may be motivated by financial gain (e.g., stealing customer data for resale), while others may be motivated by causing reputational harm (e.g., activists) or gaining a competitive edge (e.g., competitors).</li>
